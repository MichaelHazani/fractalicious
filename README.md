# three-go
## A Stripped-Down ThreeJS Boilerplate
### (intended for rapid prototyping and quick single page experiments)


## Features:

- a babelified, watchified, live-reloaded ES6 / module-based workflow 
- Orbitcontrols and a cube
- That's it. The idea is to keep fluff to a minimum.

## Installation: 

- clone
- npm install
- "npm start go" to start. Two scripts are launched (courtesy of [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) - a watcher and a browser-sync).
